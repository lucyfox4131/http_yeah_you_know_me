HTTP Yeah You Know Me
Group Member Names: Robbie, Lucy

We are hoping to get more comfortable with a partner workflow as this will be our first partner project. We hope to complete all requirements for the project so that at least a three can be achieved in each category.

We are both free to stay at Turing until 7-8. We both prefer to work remotely from home, but are happy to use screen hero.

Our primary communication will be through Slack. We plan to have a milestone checklist for our project, at the end of each milestone we will communicate progress and next steps.

I, Lucy, would like to work on refactoring and limiting dependencies. Robbie would like to work on planning significantly before starting to code. We would both like to improve on our testing, with emphasis on integration testing.

By tomorrow we would both like to be comfortable understanding the basics in the example given, and being able to start to apply that to our iterations. We will discuss more specifically yeah group members individual contributions tomorrow.

We will use git. We will communicate before we push anything.

When we run into problems implementing a feature then we will start with slack and reach out to each other, or we will reach out to instructors if neither of us know the solution.

We are both comfortable with constructive feedback and simply hope that all feedback given benefits the construction of the project.
